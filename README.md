# Fragmentioner

UI for generating the [fragmention](http://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention) link to some selected text.
Try it out here [fragmentioner demo](https://kartikprabhu.com/static/demo/fragmention.html).

## Basic Usage

* Put the fragmentioner.html code for the basic link element in your HTML file.
* Add the styles from fragmentioner.css into your stylesheet.
* Add fragmentioner.js in a script tag and you are good to go.
 
## Advanced Usage
* Use any HTML you'd like for the UI except the HTML id should be "fragmentioner-ui". Of course you are free to change this but, remember to update the id in the javascript file too.
* You can of course change any style in your own CSS for the UI.
