# Fragmentioner

UI for generating the [fragmention](http://indiewebcamp.com/fragmention) link to some selected text.
Try it out here [fragmentioner demo](https://kartikprabhu.com/static/demo/fragmention.html).

## Basic Usage

* Add the styles from fragmentioner.css into your stylesheet.
* Add fragmentioner.js in a script tag and you are good to go.
 
## Advanced Usage
* Use any HTML you'd like for the UI by changing the variable ``BUTTON_HTML`` in the javascript. Remember to update the CSS too if you change the ``id``.
* You can of course change any style in your own CSS for the UI.
